        <span style="font-size: 173%">INTRODUCTION TO SECOND
        EDITION</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This book is not a
        treatise upon the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">art</span></em> of wood-engraving. It is simply
        a description of the tools and materials required by a beginner and
        the method of using them. It is not intended to assist anyone to
        become a commercial engraver, for that trade requires a long and
        specialized training. It is intended rather for those who have
        occasion or opportunity or inclination to make illustrations or
        ornaments for books and who are revolted by the degradation to which
        the art of formal drawing has been brought by photographic
        <span class="tei tei-q">“process”</span> reproduction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“line”</span> block and the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“half-tone”</span> have one clear claim to usefulness:
        viz. when an exact facsimile is required. It is doubtful, however,
        whether process reproduction would have been developed very far if
        its use had been confined to those occasions, and those only, when
        exact facsimile was of vital importance. Process reproduction owes
        its success to its commercial possibilities more than to its real
        merits, for, in spite of the frequently reiterated boast of those
        engaged in business that nothing can be a commercial success that
        does not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“supply a want,”</span> by photographic
        reproduction a speed and cheapness have been obtained which have
        seduced both artists and the public. A <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“want”</span> has certainly been supplied, but it is a
        want of quantity rather than of quality, and, as in all cases where
        quantitative ideas are the motive force, quality has inevitably
        deteriorated so that book production has become a mere business and
        with no criterion save that of a commercial success.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is of course
        impossible to stem the tide of commercial degradation until Poverty,
        Chastity, and Obedience take the place of Riches, Pleasure, and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Laisser-faire</span></em> as personal and
        national ideals. Such a change of heart cannot occur merely as the
        result of economic or social or philosophical propaganda; the matter
        is more fundamental than that. The modern world is founded upon a
        denial of absolute values, a denial of religion, a denial of God;
        upon such denials nothing can be built. Goodness becomes what the
        police will allow or can enforce. Beauty becomes what pleases the
        senses and Truth becomes what will pay.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile it is
        possible for any individual that wills to do so to go out into the
        wilderness and to live and work in a manner more in harmony with the
        nature of man and the will of God. For it is in accord neither with
        the will of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span> God nor
        the nature of man that any one should love himself more than his
        neighbour or his neighbour more than God. The present state of
        affairs is an unnatural and abnormal thing. It is a disease. And any
        one can by the grace of God cure at least himself and put his own
        affairs in order.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the domain of
        art the remedy is the same as in any other. The thing good in itself
        must be found and loved. Relative values must give place to absolute,
        the lovely and lovable to the beautiful. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Does it pay?”</span> is not the question. Is it good in
        itself?—That is the important thing. And the more you apply that
        standard to your own work and to that of others, the more you will
        find the necessity of personal responsibility.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But personal
        responsibility for work done is, from the point of view of commercial
        success, actually an evil! Make men responsible for their work and
        not merely for doing what they are told; make their own consciences
        their masters and the whole of our modern factory system will come
        tumbling down like a house of cards. For the factory system is a
        servile system in which personal responsibility is denied and of no
        factory article may you say: this is the work of such an one—he made
        it. In the matter of drawing and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page10">[pg 10]</span> illustration and engraving, degradation is
        inevitable when one man draws, another touches up the drawing,
        another photographs, another touches up the negative, another prints
        it on the metal, another etches, another touches up the etching,
        another routs it, another mounts it, another proves it and another
        keeps the accounts and to crown all, another takes the profits. This
        excessive sub-division is inevitable where profit making is the
        motive power. It is, however, the artist and the workman who are to
        be blamed, not the man of business. (The man of business does his job
        very well. Certainly he has no right to be ruler, as he is at
        present, but it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">our</span></em> fault for allowing him to rule.)
        And as good men must precede good law, and not <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vice
        versa,</span></em> so the individual must revolt against the evil
        system and not wait until the many are prepared to revolt with him.
        Wood-engraving and wood-cutting have gone out of general use not
        because photographic process reproduction is better, or even because
        it is cheaper and quicker, but simply because larger profits can be
        made by employing many persons under a system of divided labour than
        by working in a small workshop and putting the quality of the work
        before the quantity of the output. The consumer or customer is
        flattered and his grosser appetites <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page11">[pg 11]</span> appealed to. The merchant does not ask
        himself what good thing he can supply but what he can supply at a
        good profit. The whole trouble is that the responsibility for the
        making of things is not in the hands of the workman but in those of
        the man of business—and this is hell.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The advantage of
        wood-engraving then is that it does away with several sets of middle
        men and places responsibility upon the shoulders of the workman. The
        workman who draws, engraves and prints his own blocks is master of
        the situation. He can blame nobody but himself if his work goes
        wrong. Whether it goes right or wrong depends upon his notions of
        right and wrong. The first thing is that he should be free to satisfy
        his own conscience and not be a mere tool in the hands of another.
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">Liber est causa sui, servus autem ordinatur ad
        alium</span></span> (i.e. The freeman is responsible to himself—but
        for the slave someone else is responsible. Saint Thomas Aquinas,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Summa
        Theologica).</span></em></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another advantage
        of wood-engraving is that it forces upon the workman some respect for
        the thing in itself and makes it impossible for him to place a merely
        relative value upon the art of drawing. Mere likeness to nature is
        much more easily achieved by drawing, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page12">[pg 12]</span> whether in line or wash, upon paper. The
        graver and the wood both of them make their own demands and make mere
        imitation of nature almost impossible. The workman is compelled to
        consider his work primarily as an engraving and only secondarily as a
        representation. This is a good thing, for a work of art is primarily
        a thing of Beauty in itself and not a representation of something
        else, however beautiful that other thing may be. This the public does
        not understand. Hence the absurdity of allowing the public to be
        supplied by persons who are not workmen and who have no knowledge of
        the implications of good workmanship but are simply men of business
        out to supply whatever is most profitable to themselves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He who would be an
        engraver must therefore start with a clear understanding that there
        is <span class="tei tei-q">“no money in it”</span>; though if he be
        patient and devoted he may make a living or a part of a living by it.
        Further, he must be prepared to start with the wood and the graver
        and his sense of what is beautiful in itself and not strain after
        effects. He should take it for granted that a zig-zag pattern such as
        a child would engrave is better than the most expert imitation of a
        sunset. In fact he must be pre pared to begin at the beginning and to
        put the first things first.</p>

        PRESENT</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although Mr. Eric
        Gill in his introduction has explained that this book is not a
        treatise on the art of wood-engraving, I feel constrained to add a
        chapter to the present edition of the work, chiefly on the past and
        modern styles of wood engraving; also to give some information to the
        younger craftsmen, some of whom, having lived only in an age of
        photo-mechanical reproduction, are quite unaware of the important
        part that wood engraving has had in the past for the purposes of
        book-illustration.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a very old
        craft, older than book-printing from type. It quickly became the
        chief means of decorating and illustrating books, and continued to be
        so until the invention of photographic processes, which, for general
        purposes have supplanted it. Some of the old blocks, cut in simple
        outline, fit the printed page in a most admirable manner; in their
        particular style they have not been surpassed. An example of this is
        the re-cut from <span class="tei tei-title"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">The Decameron</span></span> 1492 on page 47.
        These early blocks were all cut on the long grain of the wood, a
        method that continued until it was discovered that the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span> end grain was a better medium
        for cutting of fine lines for shading or outline.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a disputed
        point whether artists like Dürer or Holbein engraved their own work.
        It was probably left to the expert to cut in faithful facsimile the
        drawings done by the artist on wood. With a few notable exceptions,
        this method of the division of labour, the artist being one person
        and the engraver another, continued until wood-engraving was
        supplanted by process. For reproductive purposes it was a natural
        division. After that a completely new style of engraving, that of the
        present day, came into being.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thomas Bewick was
        one of the great exceptions to this division of artist and engraver.
        Not only did he engrave his own drawings, but he evolved a completely
        new style. He abandoned elaborate cross hatching, and for the most
        part cut in the most direct and simple way. Nevertheless, for
        ordinary reproductive purposes the artist and engraver continued to
        be different persons; the artist continued to draw on the wood,
        filling the shading with a wash of Indian ink and finishing by means
        of pen or pencil lines, or perhaps using the pen alone, but whether
        drawn by pen or pencil the engraver <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page15">[pg 15]</span> faithfully reproduced it, line by line. This
        necessitated great skill on the part of the engraver, for the merest
        thickening or thinning of the lines altered the effect of the
        drawing. But sometimes the drawing was done by wash only, in which
        case the engraver kept as nearly as he could to the shade or tone of
        the original without the aid of cross-hatching.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This continued
        until photography made itself felt. It is remarkable that a vast
        industry, of which the cinema is the latest development, should have
        arisen as the result of the discovery that certain substances changed
        their colour and character in the presence of light. It first greatly
        influenced wood-engraving and finally ousted it as a means of
        reproduction. Photographers found a way of photographing on to the
        wood not only drawings but other photographs, and the engraver had to
        adjust his style to the new medium, for to cut direct from a
        photograph was very different from cutting facsimile from a drawing.
        The black lines of cross-hatching disappeared and white lines took
        their place. Whenever possible a white line was cut and
        cross-hatching, where it was necessary, consisted of white lines
        crossing each other. Not only so but a method of cutting short white
        lines or dots, known <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg
        16]</span> generally as stippling, came to be used. Reproductive
        engraving speeded up and became a miracle of skill. The use of
        stipple reached its outstanding development in the work of the
        American, Timothy Cole. In his engravings of the Old Masters he got
        amazing effects of atmosphere by means of stippling alone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same
        photographic influence made itself felt amongst the commercial
        engravers of machinery. The black outlines of the machine became
        altered to white lines whenever possible, and as in the pictorial
        field, the style became completely altered. Here let me say that the
        engraving of machinery for commercial catalogues is one of the most
        exacting forms of engraving that I know. As a means of showing the
        object perfectly it holds its own to the present day. There are a
        rapidly dwindling few who still manage to get a living from it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great skill of
        the reproductive engraver was amazing. On the staff of some of the
        periodicals, where speed joined to excellence of cutting was
        essential, there were engravers who could cut a good portrait in two
        hours, and this in the style just described, line upon line in the
        perfectly free precision of the time. But this skill of the old
        reproductive <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span>
        engraver, skill largely for its own sake I fear, made more easy his
        undoing. Individuality became partly lost in the skill of technique.
        It sometimes seemed as if he were imitating his great competitor, the
        process block. The Americans were, I think, great offenders in this.
        Though a most lovely craft, wood-engraving, just before it was
        superseded by process, had not within it sufficient originality and
        power to hold its own. It was largely reproductive only: the real
        artist was too often left out. Process developed rapidly as the more
        effective way of reproducing originals of one sort or another, and
        the reproductive engraver was bereft of his craft. The output of
        engravings had been enormous. Some of the old-established printing
        and publishing firms cherish their old wood blocks: they belong to
        the furniture of the past. Others sold their blocks to the boxwood
        merchant, not by the block but by the ton!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The period just
        preceding the influence of photography was one, in the writer's
        opinion, when reproductive engraving reached its highest level for
        book illustration. The engravings of this period, if properly
        printed, appeal for the quality of their softness, their skill, and a
        sweetness of effect seldom <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg
        18]</span> accomplished by the modern style. In many of the volumes
        of this period are wood-engravings unequalled in their fidelity to
        the objects shown, and that have a beauty not surpassed by modern or
        any other engraving. But the days when they were engraved are long
        since past. We wait again for their revival, which I believe will
        come, for it is too good a thing to be entirely lost. But it cannot
        come as it came before: that never happens. The difference will be
        that the artist will do his own engraving. There are engravers of the
        present time, who, almost unconsciously, are doing work much in the
        style of this period.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The modern revival
        of wood-engraving, which came just after the war, is quite different
        in style from any that preceded it. The artist and engraver are now
        one, as they should be where original work is to be done, and every
        exponent of the craft expresses his or her own individuality. The
        technique of the old school was swept completely away. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Start engraving with an axe”</span> was an exhortation
        overheard, and some of the earliest examples, with their masses of
        unrelieved black, rather look as if they had been engraved by that
        implement. Design is the outstanding quality of the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span> present style. Twenty years
        has brought command of the engraving tool and now most excellent work
        is produced with the originality of the artist-craftsman upon it. The
        early crudeness having gone, the modern engraver brings to the
        printed page a decoration outstanding in effect. Amongst the mass of
        process reproduction is the Wood-engraver, engraving his own designs,
        thereby expressing an originality which will most certainly mark the
        present age of book-production as something well worth examination.
        It is therefore essential that the modern engraver design his own
        engravings and he will select the kind of tools which will best
        express his own individuality, for it is this individuality of the
        artist which alone amongst all its competitors will keep alive
        Wood-engraving as a vital craft.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ten engraving
        tools are as many as will be required for ordinary purposes. The
        beginner can start with five, but labour is often saved by having a
        sufficient number. They should be about 3½ inches in length,
        according to the size of the worker's hand, and when held in correct
        position the point of the tool should not extend beyond the end of
        the thumb more than half an inch. In practice the greatest freedom is
        obtained when the point extends but little beyond the thumb, but as
        some allowance must be made for repeated sharpening away on the
        oilstone, the half-inch extension is recommended. When purchased they
        are generally much longer, 6 inches, but this length is much too
        great to allow the tool to be used with ease. The makers will
        generally grind them down to the required length for the purchaser,
        an ink mark or piece of stamp paper stuck to the tool indicating
        exactly the amount to be taken off. One side of the handle is flat,
        and the tool, as it enters the handle, is slightly curved upwards.
        This is to allow for free passage of the hand and tool over the
        surface of the wood, and though tools may be without this
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span> upward curve they
        lose freedom of action by being so.</p>

        six will be known as tint-tools, three as spit-sticks, one as
        scauper. The tint-tools cut lines of uniform width from extreme
        fineness (No. 1) to much greater width (No. 6). They are used for
        tinting, that is, cutting a series of lines to produce a tint or
        shade; for outlining, especially lettering; and for scauping. The
        numbers used here are for descriptive convenience only. When
        ordering, the actual width of cut required should be given, otherwise
        the purchaser may receive something very different from what was

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spit-sticks
        (Nos. 1 to 3) are tools by which the cut can be easily broadened by
        gradually pressing the point deeper into the wood. By keeping to one
        depth they can also be used in the same manner as tint-rounded sides
        and cut through the wood with smooth ease. Instead of spit-sticks,
        tools known as gravers are often used. They are flat-sided, as
        tint-tools are, but the spread is much greater. The cut made is the
        same as that made with spit-sticks but a much greater spread is
        possible. The finest is known as the lozenge graver, the broadest as
        the square graver. They are used in the same manner as spit-sticks
        and often preferred to them, but they lack the smooth ease of cutting
        which is the special feature of spit-sticks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The scauper, the
        tool of greatest width, is used for clearing away the wood round the
        engraving. It is desirable that the belly part <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span> of this tool should be
        sufficiently rounded: a point too square will not cut through the
        wood easily. An extra tool with a square point, about the size of the
        largest tint-tool, may be found useful for taking out corners.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A good selection
        for the beginner starting with five tools only would be two
        spit-sticks (1 &amp; 3, Fig. 3), two tint tools (4 &amp; 6, Fig. 2),
        and one scauper.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must be clearly
        borne in mind that the style or character of the work is greatly
        influenced by the shape of the point used. The craftsman will be
        able, after a little time, to select the shape of tool which best
        suits his work. Once a tool is made up, and found to be good, to
        alter it is not desirable. To convert it to its old form is not easy.
        Rather keep an old one to experiment with, if needful, and never
        chance the spoiling of a proved tool.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For those who find
        a difficulty in buying tools and who wish perhaps to have them
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span> made locally, a
        good plan is to buy one good tool, and have others made to this model
        by the blacksmith, carpenter or other handy man. Old files can be
        successfully turned into quite good engraving tools. The point to
        remember is that the belly or point part of the tool be evenly shaped
        on both sides. If this is not attended to, the tool will always have
        a tendency to cut too much in one direction, or spring out of the
        wood.</p>

        used as a chisel, that is, with a mallet, is used to carve away all
        wood round the engraving, so as to leave only the engraving in
        relief. This is always necessary when the printing is done direct
        from the wood block. It is not necessary when taking hand-proofs. A
        flat tool or small chisel is useful for lowering edges which fade
        into white, for preparing small plugs and for trimming straight
        edges.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sandbag (Fig.
        7) is made of two circular pieces of leather sewn together and filled
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span> with fine sand.
        The sand is poured in just before completing the last stitches. Any
        other durable substance can be used instead of leather. On this solid
        yet easy base the block held by the left hand can be turned about at
        will. It should be not less than five inches across. To have it
        smaller may mean difficulty when engraving large blocks. A magnifying
        glass is not recommended unless the eyesight is defective. When there
        is defective vision it is safer and better to use a glass and avoid
        strain, so it must be included as a probably necessary thing. A
        double lens should be used, and should be large enough to cover a
        block of 2 or 3 inches. The stand (Fig. 8) allows the lens to be
        turned away, raised or lowered at will. A watchmaker's glass can be
        used (for one eye only) held in position over the eye by a piece of
        string round the head. It provides only a <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page26">[pg 26]</span> small field of view.</p>

        bull's-eye lens can be used as a substitute and is equally good. It
        is well to shield away by brown paper fixed to the top of the globe,
        or other means, all light that does not fall on the block. It is most
        unrestful to look up from work into the direct glare of a lamp; to
        work without a globe or bull's-eye with artificial light produces
        great eye-strain and bad work. Good light is essential at all
        times.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A supply of
        boxwood, proofing ink, an oilstone for sharpening tools and some
        paper for taking proofs will be necessary. The paper must be thin
        (India paper being the best) as <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page28">[pg 28]</span> it is very difficult to take a proof on thick
        paper.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The table or the
        bench where the work is to be done must always be firm. The craftsman
        should not be unduly bending over the work, but should be as upright
        as possible, the height of bench and chair being adjusted to enable
        the worker to see the engraving without either eye-strain or rounding
        of the back and shoulders. Be comfortable when at work.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">See that the tools
        are sharp before commencing work. If sharp the point will always grip
        or <span class="tei tei-q">“bite”</span> when loosely <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“run”</span> across the wood; if blunt it will slide
        over. Always use a spare piece of boxwood when testing tools. The
        face of the tool only must be sharpened (see Fig. 1). On no account
        must the sharpening be done from the underneath or belly part of the
        tool. Avoid bearing too much on the point; it is a quick method of
        sharpening, but the angle of the face will gradually become more
        upright and the tool will not cut through the wood easily. An angle
        of 45° is about right. Sharpen by rubbing the face of the tool up and
        down the length of the oilstone. Any lubricating oil will serve for
        the stone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wood used is
        boxwood and where fineness of work is desired no other wood is
        suitable. Dark marks sometimes indicate inferior quality; white marks
        are always bad and should be avoided. Many other kinds of wood have
        been tried for engraving without success, especially for work of a
        moderately fine character. For large work, such as are termed
        posters, sycamore and pine are principally used.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The method of
        producing these large blocks is called cutting. Knives, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“V”</span> tools and gouges, instead of gravers are used,
        and the long grain of the wood is the printing surface of these;
        whereas that which is accepted as engraving proper is always on the
        end grain of the boxwood. This being the only really reliable wood
        for wood engraving, and the engraver's staple material, it deserves
        more than a passing notice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Turkey produces
        the finest boxwood though many good samples come from the Crimea and
        the Caucasus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The best and most
        valuable wood is of very slow growth, hard and heavy, and of a very
        fine and close texture. The wood is sent over in logs. Careful
        judgment is required in its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg
        30]</span> selection when sent into the market. It must be thoroughly
        seasoned before being used by the engraver as new wood retains its
        moisture for a long time, is most liable to split and warp, and is
        very susceptible to changes of temperature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The measurement of
        the logs is from 7 to 12 inches in diameter and the first process of
        blockmaking is to cut these logs into slices crosswise about 1 inch
        in thickness. They are then placed singly in racks for many months to
        season, and during this time sharp cracks are heard which denote that
        the slices of wood are drying and splitting from the core. Owing to
        this splitting, only blocks of small size can be obtained from one
        piece; where larger blocks are required and also for the sake of
        economising wood, it is necessary to join pieces together. The best
        and strongest way is to groove and tongue them together. The sides of
        the pieces must be planed true, the grooves cut and the tongues (of
        some hard wood) glued into the grooves with very thin glue. They are
        then pressed very tightly together with clamps and left to dry.
        Another way is simply to glue the pieces together without the groove
        and tongue. In an even temperature they hold together quite well, and
        if the block is for temporary use, little <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page31">[pg 31]</span> danger need be apprehended of the joint's
        opening. Always use very thin glue thinly applied. The block has now
        to be planed down to about 7/8 of an inch thickness, which is the
        height of type, scraped with a steel scraper until perfectly level
        and smooth and finished off with the finest sand or emery paper.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
        highly-polished surface of the wood will not take the pencil or brush
        unless prepared, and the best medium for this is flake-white and
        finely ground brickdust in equal proportions. An amount sufficient to
        cover a threepenny piece is enough for a block of 6 inches by 4
        inches; add one or more drops of water, and rub thinly and evenly
        with the fingers until it starts to dry.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Chinese white may
        be used in the place of flakewhite. It can be used without the
        brick-dust and applied to the wood by the fingers as before or spread
        evenly by means of a soft flat brush passing by direct strokes over
        the surface. This method will be quite effective, but will not give
        such an even appearance as the brick-dust and white.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Indian and Chinese
        ink rubbed up in water and a fine camel hair brush are used for
        drawing, or a pencil may be used. The best is one of medium hardness.
        Too soft a pencil rubs out easily and soon gives a dirty appearance
        to the drawing; one too hard is liable to bruise the wood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All drawing on the
        wood must be reversed. Even in cases where this is not necessary it
        is well to remember that the print from the <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page33">[pg 33]</span> engraving will be a reverse of the
        drawing. Make reversing a habit. Much annoyance may thus be avoided,
        for it is easy to produce an awkward absurdity, which, though not
        apparent to other people, spoils one's own enjoyment of the work. All
        lettering must be reversed. A view of the drawing in a mirror before
        commencing to engrave will reveal any incorrectness in reversing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The engraver is to
        remember that the production is to be an engraving and not a drawing;
        that it is to have the character of an engraving—an engraving
        manifest and not an imitation of another drawing, half-tone, or any
        other process. Let the dependence be on the engraving tools rather
        than the pencil. As far as possible draw direct on to the wood. If
        this, by the nature of the subject, is impossible, it may be
        necessary to trace on to the wood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Trace the subject
        firmly with a soft pencil and by waxing the sides of the block fix
        the tracing tightly over it, face down. Affix one side first in
        correct position, rubbing the paper on to the waxed side by means of
        a tool handle or other suitable instrument, and stretch the tracing
        tightly over until fixed in similar manner to the opposite side. In
        the absence of beeswax, soap will do, but it is not <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg 34]</span> nearly so effective, or,
        failing both, the paper can be folded to the back of the block in
        such manner that movement of the tracing is impossible. Being assured
        that there will be no movement of the paper, trace again on to the
        wood by means of a hard pencil, or preferably, a steel point. If
        either of these is too sharp or pressed on too heavily, it will
        scratch or bruise the wood. By detaching the paper from one side the
        work can be examined without fear of movement, care being taken to
        fix again before continuing to trace. Only a very faint line must be
        expected and this is all that is required.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another method is
        to scrape some red chalk finely on to a separate piece of paper (not
        too large, as it can be used over and over again) and rub it well on
        until the paper is evenly reddened. Place the reddened surface next
        the wood underneath the tracing—it need not be fixed—and proceed to
        trace as before. This method will produce a faint red line and will
        be useful when, as sometimes happens, the subject is to be reversed
        in the final print.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These faint
        outlines must be made stronger, the drawing completed, by means of
        camel hair brush and Indian ink or by pencil. Any shading can be put
        into the drawing by means of these, always remembering that it is
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span> to be finally
        expressed in terms of the engraving tool. To draw on the wood is
        awkward without some support; a piece of wood as high as the block
        will be necessary on which to rest the hand.</p>

        it in position within the hand. Following the third and fourth, the
        two forefingers rest on the outer side of the blade while the thumb,
        extending beyond the fingers almost to the point, is on the inside.
        The thumb is the only part of the right hand that touches the block.
        The fingers touch <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span>
        each other in natural order: there need be no space between any. The
        tool should be laid flat upon the table, and may be taken up in one
        movement (Fig. 14). Seen from below it should then show as Fig. 15.
        Held in this way the tool will pass flat over the wood without any
        obstruction from any part of the fingers or hand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The block is held
        on the sandbag by the left hand, generally towards the corners, which
        allows the greatest freedom for turning. When cutting straight lines
        the block is held stationary, the tool-hand cutting forward; when
        cutting curves the block is turned round, the tool-hand remaining in
        one position. There is no hard rule in this, the hands acting
        flexibly for each other, but it can be seen at once when engraving
        that a circle cannot be cut unless the block is turned round in
        precise ratio to the cuts of the tool, while to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span> cut a straight line the wood
        cannot advance to the tool's point.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Engrave the lines
        one under the other, not one above the other; for circles it is much
        more easy to start the cut at the top than to start underneath,
        though to be able to start underneath is sometimes useful. The flat
        part of the handle should be just above the surface of the wood in
        cutting lines or tints, but this does not apply to all work; the
        angle at which tools are held must be determined by the shapes to be
        taken out. Do not attempt to cut a long line with one cut, but with a
        succession of short ones, and do not cut too deeply, or the line or
        wood on which the belly of the tool presses will be bruised and will
        print broken instead of clean and definite. If the tool be sharp the
        wood will chip out crisply at each cut; the lines should be cut out,
        not pushed or pressed out. Blunt tools are more responsible for slips
        than anything else except perhaps a disturbed mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Should there be
        any danger of rubbing the drawing during engraving, cover the block
        with a piece of thin paper after the manner of a tracing, first
        making a small hole where work is to commence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The craftsman is
        advised to practise by engraving something definite, something that
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span> can be used.
        Aimless cutting and digging about on bits of wood leads nowhere, for
        it is a very simple matter to cut a line that need not be cut in any
        particular place, whereas to cut the lines exactly to the subject, to
        produce something that is required is not only getting experience,
        but the result is known at once in success or failure.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Roughly speaking
        there are four different kinds of engraving, of which any variations
        and combinations can be made. The first and most natural is to cut
        white lines on black, and in many cases the subject will be
        sufficiently expressed without further work; Fig. 16 is cut in this
        way. Fig. 17 shows the background tinted or shaded, that is, lines
        cut one under the other. Fig. 18 is the black letter cleared
        (scauped) away leaving it white, while Fig. 19 shows all wood cleared
        away except outlines. Bold simple lettering is an excellent subject
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span> to begin with.
        See that the corners are joined cleanly: little jagged bits left in
        look slovenly and print in a dirty manner.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The larger
        tint-tools and scaupers are used for scauping or clearing, that is,
        for clearing a wide line round the work and cutting away all wood not
        wanted. While doing this it is essential to protect the surrounding
        work from the belly of the tool by a thin piece of card (Fig. 20). It
        must be thin yet of sufficient substance to withstand the pressure of
        the tool, for the work is done by levering out the wood as well as
        cutting it. Card soon wears out. A thin piece of hard wood or bone
        will do well if smoothed and bevelled off a little on the edge to be
        used under the tool. The thickness should be about that of a
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span> penny. When
        scauping start the cut a little away from the work gradually
        approaching until the tool has cleared away all unnecessary wood.
        Smaller pieces must of course be taken away by the smaller tools. It
        is a good plan to extend the first finger of the left hand over the
        block until it presses against the end of the thumb of the tool hand.
        This position gives great control and prevents much slipping.</p>

        clear a line round the work a little more than its own width. This is
        sufficiently wide to enable a proof to be taken. If all the wood is
        taken away it is almost impossible to proof some subjects (thin
        lettering, for instance) without a hand-press, for this wood supports
        the roller and burnisher and gives protection to the work while

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Where a light tint
        shades into white as in a sky or light parts of a dress it is
        necessary to lower the edges in some way before cutting, otherwise
        the hard edge is apt to catch the ink and cause a smudgy
        objectionable line instead of running cleanly into the white. To
        avoid this, lower or scrape the hard edge into the scauping taking
        care not to damage the surrounding wood. It can be done by the sharp
        edge of spitstick or tint-tool, or the edge can first be lowered by a
        flat scauper and then scraped smoothly into the scauping by the sharp
        edge of the engraving tool. The Section Fig. 24 shows the sharp edge
        lowered into the scauping.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Place a little
        printer's ink on a slab (which can be of stone, slate, or even glass)
        and spread it out thinly with a knife, then roll until distributed
        evenly and thinly. Avoid rolling out too much ink at once; more can
        be added easily, but to take away means cleaning the whole with
        turpentine and rag, or scraping with a knife. If a dabber be used,
        beat the ink, which is placed more in the centre of the slab, until
        quite even. The amount to roll or dab on to the block will be
        discovered quite easily after a trial or two—too much ink will blur
        the work; too little will print grey. Place the paper on the inked
        block without slurring it, and on the paper drop a thin piece of
        card—a postcard will do—hold down by the left hand and rub on the top
        of the card with the burnisher until an impression is taken. The
        print can be examined from time to time by lifting a corner, holding
        the remaining paper down firmly with the left hand on the card. More
        burnishing must be applied to those parts which have not taken the
        ink. If the engraved lines be fine, light pressure must be given to
        the burnisher lest the lines be bruised, whereas if the parts are
        black heavier pressure must be given. A little oil rubbed on
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span> one side of the
        card—the side on which the burnisher is to be applied—then rubbed off
        again, will allow the burnisher to slide over with ease and prevent
        sticking; while if the burnisher is applied without the card,
        bruising is liable to occur to fine lines. India paper is excellent
        on which to take proofs by hand. Other kinds can be used if free from
        ridges and not too thick. The thicker the paper the greater will be
        the difficulty in getting a print, for the ink does not stick it to
        the block, as is the case with thin paper, and any examination of the
        print nearly always moves the paper out of position and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“doubling”</span> is the result.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This first print
        is often called the <span class="tei tei-q">“overlay.”</span> It
        shows not only the engraving but all the surrounding wood and pieces
        between that have been too large to be cut away by a scauper. To take
        a proof of the engraving only, these black pieces on the overlay must
        be cut out cleanly with a sharp knife or the point of a tint-tool,
        and, after inking the block again, these pieces are placed on their
        corresponding parts on the wood. They are thus blocked
        out—overlayed—by the pieces of paper cut from the first print. Place
        fresh paper on the block and proof as before, greater care however is
        necessary to prevent <span class="tei tei-q">“doubling.”</span> Where
        plenty of black is in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg
        45]</span> engraving the process is simple, but if the subject is of
        thin lines, such as fine lettering, it is a somewhat delicate
        operation. In this case the less it is examined whilst the proof is
        being taken the better.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the process
        of engraving, in order to see exactly what has been done so far, one
        may wish to take a proof. But the inking of the block would
        obliterate that part of the drawing which has not yet been engraved.
        Instead, therefore, of taking a proof with ink the following method
        will be found convenient:—Press some <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">precipitated
        chalk</span></em>(obtainable at any chemist's) into the engraved part
        and wipe the surface clean with the palm of the hand thus leaving the
        chalk in the hollows and incisions only. The block will then appear
        exactly as in a print (only not reversed), i.e. the surface of the
        wood will show dark against the white chalk.</p>

        be sent to the printer all unnecessary wood has to be taken away, and
        if there are large surfaces this is best done by gouge and mallet.
        First saw the block square to within ¼ of an inch of work, then fix
        it in a vice or clamp to a bench. Use the gouge as a chisel, never
        forgetting to have the cutting edge pointing towards centre of block.
        If used towards the edges pieces of wood will suddenly chip away and
        the last stroke of the mallet will, perhaps, ruin the work, though an
        experience of this kind is seldom repeated. The block will have to be
        turned about in the vice to enable the gouging to be made towards the
        centre and care must be taken to hold the gouge high enough just to
        clear the work and so prevent bruising. The wood must be taken away
        deeply. If cut too shallow, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg
        47]</span> the ridges formed by the gouge will pick up the ink from
        the roller which ink again will be picked up by the paper whilst
        proofing. Any edges or small pieces that the gouge cannot clear away
        must be trimmed off with the scauper, the card being used to protect
        the work.</p><a name="fig18" id="fig18"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If some small
        mistake has arisen such as a deep bruise, false cut, slip, etc., it
        can be made good by plugging, that is, by the insertion of a new
        piece of wood where the mistake has occurred. This requires skill and
        care, for the new piece of wood must fit in exactly, otherwise a
        white line will show all round it. For very small plugs the simplest
        method of making a hole is to get a carpenter's nail, round or square
        type, according to the shape of the plug required, file the sides to
        the right size and flatten the bottom, finally getting the edges and
        bottom sharp and smooth on the oil-stone. Drive this into the wood,
        about 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch according to the size of the plug. Take
        the nail out again by a straight pull to avoid bruising the sides,
        and if the nail has been properly shaped, a clean hole with sharp
        edges will be the result. Into this hole insert a piece of boxwood,
        trimmed to exact size by means of a flat tool or chisel, then gently
        hammer with a piece of wood until the bottom of the hole is felt. To
        dip the end of the plug into thin glue or gum before insertion will
        help to keep it fast, but small plugs accurately trimmed will hold
        without glue. For larger plugs glue must be used.</p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through a thin
        piece of card cut a hole large enough to allow the head of the plug
        to protrude, place it in the block to protect the engraving, then cut
        off the projecting head close to the card with a fine saw. By means
        of the scauper and card, always cutting towards the centre, lower the
        remaining projection until nearly level with surrounding surface, and
        finish off with the chisel laid flat on the block. An excellent tool
        with which to get the plug level is a fine tint-tool laid on its side
        and used as a chisel, chisel or tint-tool being used in a slicing
        movement and not driven.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two or three
        plugging nails, made ready and kept for the purpose, will be all that
        are required for smaller plugs. The holes can also be made by drills
        such as are used for fretwork. Larger plugs must be scauped or
        chiselled out, taking care that the sides go straight down and that
        the edges are without a bruise. The larger the plug, the deeper must
        be the hole, the depth for large plugs being half-way through the
        block. Plugs on the extreme edge of the block require more care but
        the difficulties can nearly always be <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page50">[pg 50]</span> overcome by a little ingenuity. A drop of
        water placed on a bruise will often bring it to the surface again.
        Hot water is still more effective, while, if the bruising is deep and
        general, steaming the whole surface is the best method though it
        makes the wood rotten and disagreeable to cut on afterwards.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The method of
          wood-engraving which is described in this book is distinct from
          that known properly as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“wood-cutting”</span>. The <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“woodcut”</span> is done with a knife on the long grain
          of the wood instead of the end grain. It is necessarily done on
          soft wood and is therefore less suitable for use in conjunction
          with type in a printing press, except for large work. But the
          wood-engraver should certainly practise the art of wood-cutting
          also and for the purpose he will require, in addition to some
          planks of pear wood or a similar fine-grained wood, a knife and
          several wood-carver's chisels and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page52">[pg 52]</span> gouges—the first for cutting lines and
          edges and the latter for cutting away the background. The knife
          (Fig. 27) is the most important of these tools and the best form is
          like a very fine carpenter's chisel with a small handle, such as
          can be grasped in the fingers, a short blade about one inch long,
          three-eighths of an inch wide and as thin as that of a pen-knife,
          with the cutting end ground at an angle of about 30° with the upper
          edge.</p>

          much as a pen is held for writing and, of course, the cut is made
          always in the direction which does not burr the grain of the wood
          just as a skewer is sharpened by cutting towards and not away from
          its point.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although in
          connection with the printing press the wood-cut has not the same
          usefulness as the wood-engraving on account of the soft wood
          necessarily used and the impossibility of doing the finest work
          with the same degree of precision, nevertheless, as an independent
          art that of wood-cutting is on an <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page53">[pg 53]</span> equality with any other, and, in one
          respect, the fact that only soft wood can be used is an advantage;
          for such wood, pine or pear, is more easy to get than a hard
          foreign wood like the Turkish box-wood. The wood-cutter may
          therefore go into his own back garden for his material and is
          independent of the foreign merchant. The difficulty of the
          wood-engraver in this matter is, however, not quite insuperable,
          for, if properly seasoned and prepared, holly or blackthorn are
          quite good for end grain work and, though not as hard as boxwood,
          make a very fair substitute.</p>

              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important

              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written

              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace
              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
              The replaced older file is renamed. <em class=
              "tei tei-emph"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate
              sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and
              etext numbers.</p>
